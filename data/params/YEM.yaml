      Formal sector employees and government workers. System severely disrupted by
      civil war since 2015; rival administrations in Sanaa and Aden each claim authority
      over PSIC. Effective coverage near zero for private sector workers; limited
      government pension payments continue in some areas from donor support.

    World Bank Yemen Economic Update 2022 – rough estimate.
    Formal sector (where functioning) monthly wage ~YER 100,000/month × 12 = YER 1,200,000/year.
    YER split: Sanaa-issued YER (Houthi) and Aden-issued YER have different exchange rates.
    Average at Aden rate ~YER 1,250/USD: $80/month purchasing power – one of the lowest
    globally. ILOSTAT data unavailable.
  notes: >
    EXTREME UNCERTAINTY. Yemen is experiencing one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
    The YER has split: Sanaa (Houthi) and Aden (government) notes trade at different rates.
    Economic data is extremely unreliable. All figures are rough estimates.

notes: >
  Yemen's pension system has virtually collapsed since the civil war began in 2015.
  PSIC operations are minimal. Government employees in Aden have received partial
  salary/pension payments through international support. Sanaa-based (Houthi)
  government controls PSIC headquarters but has limited financial resources.
  This entry documents the legal framework only. Any pension analysis for Yemen
  should be treated as theoretical given the humanitarian emergency context.
