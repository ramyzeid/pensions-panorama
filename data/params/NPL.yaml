notes: >
  Nepal's contributory social security system (SSF) is among the newest in the MENAAP
  region, fully operational only since 2020. Coverage is expanding but remains limited.
  The scheme provides comprehensive social insurance (health, accident, maternity, and
  retirement). For most Nepali workers, remittances from abroad (Nepal has one of the
  highest remittance/GDP ratios globally) supplement any retirement income.
  The universal Old Age Allowance (NPR 4,000/month) provides a modest safety net for all
  citizens aged 70+.
