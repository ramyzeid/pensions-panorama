    Average public/formal sector monthly wage ~IQD 750,000/month × 12 = IQD 9,000,000/year.
    Public sector wages dominate due to oil-revenue funded government employment.

  notes: >
    Iraq's economy is heavily oil-dependent. ~40% of formal employment is public sector.
    Private formal sector wage data is limited due to large informal economy (~60%+ informality).

notes: >
  Iraq has two parallel pension systems: the National Retirement Authority (NRA) covering
  government employees and the Social Security Commission (SSC) covering the private sector.
  In practice, the NRA is far more important given Iraq's large public sector.
  The private sector social security system has very limited coverage and enforcement.
  The pension system was disrupted during 2003-2010; many older retirees' records were lost.
  Oil revenues fund government pensions directly, reducing fiscal pressure on the NRA fund.
