notes: >
  The SSO covers roughly 40% of the labour force (formal private sector workers).
  Government employees are covered separately by the Civil Servants Pension Fund (صندوق بازنشستگی
  کشوری). The SSO system offers relatively generous replacement rates (up to 100% of reference wage
  at 30 years) but the reference wage is based on the last 2 years, which may exceed career average
  for wage earners. Severe economic sanctions and hyperinflation complicate international comparisons.
