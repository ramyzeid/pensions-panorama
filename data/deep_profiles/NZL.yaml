    New Zealand operates a two-tier retirement income system. The first tier is
    New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) — a universal, tax-funded flat-rate pension
    payable to all residents aged 65+ regardless of employment history or
    contributions, set at approximately 40% of the average wage per person.
    The second tier is KiwiSaver, an auto-enrolled defined-contribution scheme
    open to all employees and the self-employed. Workers are automatically enrolled
    on starting a new job and contribute a minimum 3% of gross earnings, matched
    by a mandatory 3% employer contribution, plus a government member tax credit
    of up to NZD 521/year. Members may opt out within 56 days of enrollment.
    KiwiSaver funds are locked until age 65 (with limited exceptions for first
    home purchase and financial hardship).
