notes: 'Turkey''s pension system underwent major reforms in 2006 (Law 5510) unifying three previously separate schemes (SSK
  for private sector, Bağ-Kur for self-employed, Emekli Sandığı for civil servants) into SGK. A complex transitional regime
  remains for pre-reform cohorts. The NRA is being phased up to 65; effective retirement ages in 2022 were considerably lower
  for cohorts grandfathered under old rules. Individual Pension System (BES) operates as a voluntary third pillar with government
  matching contributions (25-30%). The SGK replacement rate approximation of 2%/year on career average is a simplification
  of the actual premium-day formula.
