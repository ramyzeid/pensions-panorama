    Pension income from NSIF is generally exempt from income tax up to EGP 15,000/year.
    Above this threshold, regular personal income tax brackets apply (0–25%).
    Effective rate for average-wage pensioners is low due to generous exemption thresholds.

notes: >
  Egypt's pension system covers formal-sector workers through NSIF.
  Coverage of informal workers (estimated >50% of labour force) is minimal.
  The 2019 reform unified several funds and introduced career-average valorisation.
