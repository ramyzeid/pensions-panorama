    Employer contributions are exempt. Pension income in retirement is subject to
    IIT at progressive rates; basic pension below threshold is effectively exempt
    for most retirees given low average UEBP amounts. Enterprise Annuity (EA)
    contributions benefit from EET treatment under MOF/SAT Circular [2013] No. 103.

notes: >
  China is implementing a phased retirement age reform starting 2025 that will raise the
  NRA from 60 to 63 for males and from 55/50 to 58 for females over 15 years.
  The individual account component is often referred to as a notional DC (NDC-like)
  in practice, as many provincial pools have depleted account funds and pay from
  current revenues. Enterprise Annuity (EA) provides supplementary DC coverage for
  ~30 million workers (mainly SOE employees).
