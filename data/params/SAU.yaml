notes: >
  GOSI covers Saudi national private-sector employees only (mandatory).
  Non-Saudi workers (~75% of private-sector workforce) receive only End-of-Service Benefit (EOSB),
  a lump-sum gratuity of 1 month per year of service, not modeled as a pension here.
  Civil servants are covered by the Public Pension Agency (PPA), which is a separate scheme.
