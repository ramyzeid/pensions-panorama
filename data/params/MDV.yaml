  notes: >
    Maldives has a high per-capita income (upper-middle income) driven by tourism.
    The pension system is relatively comprehensive for such a small island nation (~540,000 people).
    Foreign workers constitute a significant share of the labour force.

notes: >
  The Maldives pension system is notable for its combination of a universal non-contributory
  basic pension (OABP: MVR 5,000/month) and a mandatory contributory DC scheme (MRPS).
  The OABP is generous relative to AW for a low-income retiree, providing 25% of formal AW.
  The MPAO is an independent body established under the Pension Act 2009 and has received
  international praise for good governance in the South Asian context.
  With only ~540,000 citizens (and ~200,000 foreign workers), Maldives has a small but
  well-structured system for the region.
