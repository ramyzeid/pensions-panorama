notes: >
  Djibouti's economy is strategically important as a port and logistics hub.
  It hosts several foreign military bases (US, France, China, Japan, Italy) which
  provide significant employment but not covered by CNSS.
  The CNSS covers formal private sector workers; civil servants are covered by the
  Office de Protection Sociale (OPS) with a separate DB pension.
  Social security data is limited; figures are estimates based on available ILO and
  World Bank reports.
