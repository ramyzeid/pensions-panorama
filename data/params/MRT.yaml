notes: >
  Mauritania's CNSS covers only a small fraction of the labour force due to the large
  informal economy (estimated 75%+ of workers). Civil servants are covered separately
  by the Caisse de Retraite des Fonctionnaires et Assimilés (CRFA). The contribution
  ceiling (2× SMIG) is very low relative to actual wages, severely limiting replacement rates.
  The note about contribution ceiling expressed as multiple of SMIG rather than AW is important
  for interpreting results.
