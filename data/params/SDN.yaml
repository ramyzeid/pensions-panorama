    Estimated from World Bank Sudan Economic Monitor 2022 and ILO data.
    Formal sector average monthly wage ~SDG 100,000/month × 12 = SDG 1,200,000/year.
    EXTREME UNCERTAINTY: Sudan experienced ~200%+ inflation in 2022.
    SDG lost ~80% of value; nominal wages rising rapidly in SDG terms.
    ILOSTAT data unavailable; manual estimate only.
  notes: >
    Sudan experienced severe economic crisis: hyperinflation (~245% in 2022), currency
    collapse, political instability (military coup October 2021), and armed conflict
    (Darfur, civil war escalating in 2023). All statistics carry extreme uncertainty.

notes: >
  Sudan's social security system has been severely undermined by decades of economic
  crises, sanctions (US sanctions lifted 2017), political instability, and the loss of
  oil revenues following South Sudan's independence in 2011.
  The NSIF covers a small fraction of workers; coverage is concentrated in Khartoum
  and other major urban centres.
  Civil servants are covered by a separate Public Pension Fund (PPF).
  In practice, most Sudanese workers have no formal pension coverage.
