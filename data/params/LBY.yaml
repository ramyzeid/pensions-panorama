    Average public sector monthly salary ~LYD 3,500/month × 12 = LYD 42,000/year.
    Private sector data unavailable. Libya's economy dominated by public oil revenues.
    ILOSTAT data unavailable due to conflict.
  notes: >
    Libya's economy and labour statistics have been severely disrupted since 2011.
    Dual government situation means limited reliable statistical data. The oil sector
    provides the majority of government revenue and public sector wages are subsidised.
    These estimates carry very high uncertainty.

notes: >
  Libya's social security system was established under the pre-Gaddafi era and expanded
  significantly during the oil-boom years. Since the 2011 revolution and subsequent
  civil conflict, the system has operated with significant disruption. The Central Bank
  of Libya and SSF operations are fragmented. However, public sector pensions (the
  majority of pension recipients) continue to be paid from oil revenues.
  The formal legal framework (Law No. 13/1980) remains technically in force but enforcement
  is limited in conflict-affected areas.
