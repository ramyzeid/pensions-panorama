  Jordan's SSC scheme is a funded defined-benefit scheme administered by the
  Social Security Corporation (SSC), a public autonomous institution.
  The reform of 2014 (Law No. 1/2014) unified previously separate private and
  government worker schemes and introduced parametric changes including a higher
  NRA trajectory.  Civil servants hired before 2014 may be covered by the legacy
  Civil Service Retirement (CSR) scheme, which is not modeled here.
