  notes: >
    Palestine uses the Israeli New Shekel (ILS) as the primary currency (West Bank),
    alongside Jordanian Dinar (JOD) and USD. No separate Palestinian currency.
    Gaza Strip has significantly lower wages and different employment structure.
    Statistics exclude Gaza unless specified.

notes: >
  Palestine's pension situation is complex: civil servants (ARSS) have a functioning system;
  private sector workers have a newly implemented system (SSI, from 2021); Gaza workers
  are largely excluded or covered by Hamas-run arrangements.
  The Israeli occupation restricts labour market access and affects social security
  portability for Palestinians working in Israel or settlements.
  UN agencies (UNRWA) provide separate social services for Palestinian refugees.
