notes: >
  Indonesia has a fragmented pension landscape: BPJS Ketenagakerjaan covers private formal
  sector; TASPEN covers civil servants; ASABRI covers military/police. Coverage of the
  informal economy (~60% of workforce) is negligible. The JP scheme is still immature
  (launched 2015) and maximum benefit will only be meaningful for workers contributing
  for full careers. JHT, while a provident fund (DC), historically allowed early withdrawals
  weakening retirement adequacy.
