# Morocco (MAR) – Pension System Parameters
# =============================================================================
# Curated reference year: 2023
#
# Morocco has a fragmented multi-pillar pension landscape:
#   CNSS  – Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (private sector)
#   RCAR  – Régime Collectif d'Allocation de Retraite (contractual public)
#   CMR   – Caisse Marocaine des Retraites (civil servants)
#   CIMR  – Caisse Interprofessionnelle Marocaine de Retraite (complementary)
#
# This file models CNSS (main mandatory private-sector scheme) as a DB scheme.
# The 2016 pension reform introduced parametric changes; the government is
# pursuing further consolidation into a unified pension system (two-pillar).

  income_tax_on_pension: >
    Pension income is subject to the general progressive income tax (IGR/IR) in Morocco.
    However, pensioners benefit from a 40% deduction from gross pension before tax,
    with a minimum deduction of MAD 15,000/year and maximum of MAD 40,000/year.
    Social security pensions received from CNSS also benefit from further exemptions
    up to certain thresholds.  The simplified_net_rate below represents the effective
    rate for a worker at 1×AW after applicable deductions.

      Estimated effective combined rate (income tax + AMO) at 1×AW pension income
      after 40% pension deduction. Derived from CGI Art. 73 brackets and AMO rates (2023).
      At 1×AW pension (~MAD 98,748/yr): taxable = 60% = MAD 59,249; tax ≈ MAD 5,370 (9%);
      AMO = MAD 2,227 (2.26%). Total deduction ≈ 7.7% → rounded to 8%.
    year: 2023
  notes: >
    Morocco applies the EET framework for mandatory social security contributions.
    The effective net rate varies significantly by income level; the 8% simplified
    rate is a conservative midpoint for the 0.5–1.5×AW range.
    A full bracket calculation would require implementing the CGI Art. 73 schedule.

notes: >
  Morocco's pension system is fragmented across multiple funds (CNSS, CMR, RCAR, CIMR).
  This file models only the CNSS mandatory branch, which covers the largest share of the
  formal private-sector workforce.
  A 2021 World Bank study recommended consolidation; reform proposals are ongoing (2023-2024).
  The CNSS insurable wage ceiling (MAD 6,000/month in 2023) creates a strong redistributive
  element, since higher earners contribute on a capped base but receive proportionally
  lower replacement rates.
