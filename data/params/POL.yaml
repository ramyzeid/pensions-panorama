  - year: 1999
    title: "Systemic Reform — DB to NDC + Mandatory DC (OFE)"
    description: >
      Replaced the old defined-benefit PAYG system with a two-pillar structure: a notional defined
      contribution (NDC) first pillar (ZUS) and a mandatory funded DC second pillar (OFE). Created
      individual accounts and changed the benefit formula fundamentally.
