notes: >
  EOBI is a modest scheme with very low replacement rates relative to actual wages because
  contributions are based on the minimum wage, not the actual insurable wage.
  The 2022 minimum pension of PKR 8,500/month is the primary driver of pension income for
  most EOBI retirees. Informal workers (~73% of labour force) have no mandatory pension coverage.
