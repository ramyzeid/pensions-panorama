notes: >
  Turkey's pension system underwent major reforms in 2006 (Law 5510) unifying three previously
  separate schemes (SSK for private sector, Bağ-Kur for self-employed, Emekli Sandığı for civil
  servants) into SGK. A complex transitional regime remains for pre-reform cohorts.
  The NRA is being phased up to 65; effective retirement ages in 2022 were considerably lower
  for cohorts grandfathered under old rules. Individual Pension System (BES) operates as a
  voluntary third pillar with government matching contributions (25-30%). The SGK replacement rate
  approximation of 2%/year on career average is a simplification of the actual premium-day formula.
