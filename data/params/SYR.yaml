    World Bank Syria Economic Monitor 2022 – very rough estimate.
    Average formal sector wage in government-controlled areas ~SYP 600,000/month × 12
    = SYP 7,200,000/year nominal (2022). SYP has lost >95% of pre-conflict value.
    At unofficial rate ~SYP 4,000-5,000/USD in 2022: ~$1,440/year purchasing power
    equivalent – reflecting severe impoverishment. ILOSTAT data unavailable.
  notes: >
    EXTREME UNCERTAINTY. Syria is in a prolonged civil war since 2011. GDP contracted
    ~60% from pre-war levels. SYP hyperinflation (black market rate ~SYP 4,500/USD in 2022
    vs official SYP 3,015/USD). All economic statistics are unreliable.

notes: >
  Syria's pension system nominally follows the pre-2011 GOSI framework, but in practice
  is heavily disrupted. Large parts of the population (IDPs, refugees – estimated 13 million
  displaced) have no access to GOSI. The government continues paying public sector pensions
  in regime-controlled areas from state budget resources.
  All figures carry extreme uncertainty. This entry documents the legal framework
  and should not be used for policy analysis without significant caveats.
