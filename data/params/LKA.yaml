notes: >
  Sri Lanka's EPF/ETF system is a pure defined-contribution provident fund paying lump sums,
  not annuities. This limits comparability with DB pension systems. The government has considered
  converting EPF into an annuity-paying scheme but no reform was enacted as of 2022.
  Government/public sector employees have a separate, non-contributory defined benefit pension
  (pensions paid from current government budget). Only ~35% of the workforce is covered by EPF.
  The 2022 economic crisis caused significant erosion of EPF real values.
