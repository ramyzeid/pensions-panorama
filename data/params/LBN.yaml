  notes: >
    Lebanon experienced a catastrophic financial collapse from 2019 onward. The LBP lost
    over 95% of its value versus the USD. There is no reliable single exchange rate or average
    wage figure for 2022. ILOSTAT data is unavailable/unreliable. The manual_value is a
    rough estimate based on USD-converted purchasing power. Comparisons with other countries
    using AW-relative metrics will be unreliable for Lebanon.

notes: >
  Lebanon's NSSF EOSI is one of the few remaining provident fund / end-of-service indemnity
  systems in the region, modeled after older Arab social security frameworks. It is NOT a
  traditional pension. There is no mandatory annuitization; workers receive a lump sum.
  The government has repeatedly discussed converting to a real pension system (most recently
  through the 2019 NSSF Reform discussions) but no reform was enacted.
  The system is further undermined by: (1) the banking system collapse (NSSF funds were
  deposited in Lebanese banks and lost significant value), (2) hyperinflation eroding real
  payouts, (3) lack of indexation. Most Lebanese workers have effectively lost their retirement
  savings as of 2022.
