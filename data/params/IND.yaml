notes: 'India''s pension system covers a very small fraction of the total workforce (organised sector ~12%). The Atal Pension
  Yojana (APY) provides a small guaranteed pension (INR 1,000-5,000/month) for informal workers. Most Indians rely on family
  support and EPF lump sums in retirement. EPS replacement rates are very low relative to actual wages due to the statutory
  wage ceiling of INR 15,000/month (unchanged since 2014). The NPS provides meaningful retirement savings only for government
  employees with the 14% employer contribution.
