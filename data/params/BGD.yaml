    Bangladesh's economy is dominated by the RMG sector (garment exports) with very low wages.
    Formal AW here reflects non-RMG formal sector workers more likely to have pension coverage.

notes: >
  Bangladesh has one of the lowest formal pension coverage rates in South Asia.
  Over 85% of workers are in the informal economy with NO pension coverage.
  The civil service pension covers ~1.5 million workers. There is no mandatory pension for
  private sector workers.
  The Universal Pension Scheme (UPS) launched in August 2023 is a voluntary contributory
  scheme (outside this 2022 reference year). The Labour Act 2006 requires employers to pay
  a gratuity (30 days wage per year) for workers with 10+ years of service, but this is an
  end-of-service lump sum, not a recurring pension.
